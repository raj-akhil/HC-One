There's is a PowerBI file which will open the dashboard. 
For testing the dashboard we have created a sample data in csv format named as "Book1.xslx".

Steps to start it:
1. Unzip in specific folder.	
2. Open the .pixb file.
3. Play with the Candidate Search Bar, try searching any Candidate-ID and the dashboard will show you the basic information of the Candidate.


Thank You.
