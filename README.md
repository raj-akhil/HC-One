# Hc-One
## STRUCTURED ABSTRACT  
### Context  
HC-One currently scours through thousands of applications every week for care home workers and
nurses. However, this activity requires the recruitment team to manually evaluate the likelihood
of each candidate being a successful hire or not. This process is very tedious and time consuming
and may result in the loss of quality candidates.
### Objectives
The main objective of this investigation is to evaluate whether each candidate would be a successful
hire or not using the CRISP-DM framework. This would simplify the recruitment process and
reduce the time and resources required to review each applicant.
